Title: Multi-Class Classification of Iris Species using Neural Networks

Introduction:
The goal of this project is to create a neural network model to classify the Iris dataset into three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset is preprocessed, and a neural network model is trained using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, a well-known dataset in machine learning. It contains information about four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) of iris flowers, with each instance belonging to one of three species.

Data Preprocessing:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

The initial exploration involves checking the first few rows of the dataset, understanding the distribution of species, and checking for missing values. The dataset appears clean, and there are no missing values.
Label Encoding:

The species column is label-encoded using the LabelEncoder from scikit-learn. This is necessary for the neural network to interpret the target variable.
Feature Scaling:

StandardScaler is applied to scale the features. Scaling is crucial for neural networks as it ensures that all features contribute equally to the model.
Train-Test Split:

The dataset is split into training and testing sets with a 70-30 ratio using train_test_split from scikit-learn.
Model Architecture:
Neural Network Architecture:

The neural network model consists of three layers: two hidden layers with ReLU activation functions and one output layer with softmax activation. The model is designed to handle input shapes corresponding to the number of features.
Compiling the Model:

The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. The metric tracked during training is accuracy.
Training the Model:

The model is trained for 100 epochs on the training data.
Model Evaluation:
Predictions:

The trained model is used to make predictions on the test set.
Performance Metrics:

Accuracy score and confusion matrix are calculated to evaluate the model's performance.
Confusion Matrix Visualization:

A heatmap using Seaborn is created to visualize the confusion matrix. The heatmap provides insights into how well the model is performing in classifying each species.
Results:
Accuracy:

The accuracy of the model on the test set is calculated and reported.
Confusion Matrix:

The confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of the model's predictions, allowing for a deeper understanding of its strengths and weaknesses.
Conclusion:
The neural network model successfully classifies Iris species with high accuracy. The confusion matrix and visualization help to identify any specific challenges or patterns in misclassifications. Further fine-tuning or exploration of more advanced architectures may be considered for potential improvements. Overall, the project demonstrates the application of neural networks for multi-class classification tasks using the Iris dataset.
